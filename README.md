# embedded-cpp
The examples of my "Embedded C++" course. We start with these examples and elaborate them during the course.

The repository contains folders for each chapter. In each chapter, there are subfolders for each topic.

The C++ code inside this directory follows [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) formatting style.
