# embedded-cpp
The examples of my "Embedded C++" course. We start with these examples and elaborate them during the course.

The repository contains folders for each chapter. In each chapter, there are subfolders for each topic.

The C++ code inside this directory follows [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) formatting style.

To run the tasks defined in tasks.json from within VS Code, please change the extension of "mingw_multi_file_build.txt" file to "bat"!
